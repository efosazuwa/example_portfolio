# My Portfolio
A Sampling of Data Science projects that I have completed or I'm working on.

# [Project 1: Electric Vehicle Charging Detection(Unfinished)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1imM6GxT0zFiLUi0VVbpDA_JsNNKIwn16#scrollTo=O6a21YEWCzbF)
* Build visualizations that identify annomalies with seaborn and plotly
* Engineered features from primary dataset 
* Investigate annomaly detection with naive gaussian methods, Isolation forrests, and Local Outlier Factor. 
* TODO build different forecasting models with ARMA FFT, and RNN
* TODO Build a client facing API using flask

# [Project 2: Authorship Identification With Markov Chains(Unfinished)](https://github.com/efosazuwa/markov_project)
For this example project I built an authorship identification model with markov chains as the engine. I presented this as my senior project in probability and the presentation can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Hekx661TCKPk-plh0Qi3wfAaYu22OFJeHjzL5LfukWA/edit?usp=sharing). The concept of authorship analysis isn't new but chaining the base results of a markov chain with other machine learning results may net some interesting results
* I was able to demonstrate a lower probabiity score between a true shakespeare work and a forgery
* TODO Extract more features to put into a logistic regression
* TODO Build a client facing API using flask
